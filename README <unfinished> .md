# Gluc-Cog Project Overview

## Introduction

The Department of Nutrition, Dietetics, and Food Science at Brigham Young University aimed to determine in this study the effects of the AS aspartame, the caloric sugar sucrose, and water on short-term cognitive performance. In addition, glucose samples were collected as both a process measure and to correlate changes in blood glucose with any changes in cognitive performance. They hypothesized that an 11% sucrose-sweetened beverage would improve cognitive performance after a fasted state (as glucose levels rise) compared to the 0.05% aspartame-sweetened beverage or water ~20, and ~60 minutes post-consumption. They also inferred the aspartame and water groups would perform similarly in cognitive tasks as well as in blood glucose response. 

I served as the main research assistant in statistical analysis, and my role was to organize their laboratory data and test their hypotheses. Over the course of a year and a half, I have cleaned messy data, manipulated variables, performed and fitted varying models, and visualized the results. My progress was regularly checked by my statistics professor/advisor, and I regularly communicated work to those in the NDFS Department.

This folder contains the contents of the Gluc-Cog project. The project consists of four folders:
1) Raw Data
2) Scripts
3) Cleaned Data
4) Outputs

## 1: Raw Data

Raw data was collected from the department-funded research team. Lab data was collected to gather subject lifestyle and body composition information. Cognitive data from participants were collected using the NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery Tests. In summary, the data collected from the experiment was as follows:

1. Subject demographics, such as race, gender, age, and employment, marital, medical status.
2. Subject body characteristics, which includes measurements of weight, height, fat mass, body fat percentage, or visceral adipose tissue.
3. Visual Analog Scale, a subjective measure regarding treatments consumption and appearance
4. Blood glucose concentrations, measured four times per participant, evaluating measure of glucose circulating in the bloodstream.
5. Cognitive performance, measured three times, evaluating mental acuity in different cognitive domains (working memory, executive function, etc).
